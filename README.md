Automating functionality for Tesla

## Auto Venting
It's hot out. Sun is streaming in. Interior temperatures can exceed 100Â°F, damaging the cars interior and making it uncomfortable when you get in. Tesla has a feature to cool down the cabin when it gets hot, but this uses up battery.

Yes, you can open the app to vent, but it's not ideal to have to remember to do it every time you park. It's also nice to only vent the windows when it is hot, not all the time.

autovent solves this by allowing you to set a threshold for venting

`python autovent.py --help` for usage
